# Advanced-JavaScript-Assignment-Constructor-Word-Guess
Advanced JavaScript Assignment: Constructor Word Guess/ will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions. 

OVERVIEW: 
This application is a guessing game based on input from the user. Three files will be used and depend on eachother to take the user input in to check against the input to create a word. A letter will be checked to update to the word, if the user is correct or incorrect the application will display that information and reveal the word to the user. The npm package inquirer/prompt will be used to keep track of the user's guesses.
